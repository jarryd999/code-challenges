## React

### The Challenge: 

Here is a very basic react app. It lists some items. You can click to select, and there is a filter you can change. 

You must update the app to:
- [ ] Fetch "source" filters remotely from `http://www.kiddom.co/content/types.json`
- [ ] Fetch items remotely from `http://www.kiddom.co/content.json?source=${key}` based on the selected filter

This is a live coding exercise, not a take-home. 


TODO:
Fetch items based off initial filter
